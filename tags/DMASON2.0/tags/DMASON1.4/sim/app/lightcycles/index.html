<h2>Light Cycles</h2> 
By Daniel Kuebrich
</table>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Cycle">Light Cycles</a> is one of the fictional games in the classic 1982 movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron_(movie)">Tron</a>.  The movie's version of the game has sponsored <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=light+cycles+game">numerous</a> real versions</a>.  Each player in a square arena controls "light cycle", a motorcycle which, as it moves forward, draws a wall of light behind it.  The objective is to wall in your opponent, forcing him to crash into a light-wall or into the arena's edge.

<p>Our version of the game is a simple discrete-grid demo.  The players in the game are all controled by basic AIs, but the user can choose one to override and control himself.
