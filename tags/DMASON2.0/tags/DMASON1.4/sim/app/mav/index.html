<h2>Miro Air Vehicles</h2> 
By Sean Luke
</table>

<p>This demo is derived from the early mock-up of a micro air vehicle (MAV) simulation we did for multiagent machine learning experiments.  The final version is much more complex, but the demo is still instructive.

<p>An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Air_Vehicle">MAV</a> is a small flying robot, primarily for reconnaisance.  The environment consists of ground areas of interest (colored regions) and a swarm of MAVs.  In this simple version, each MAV can sense the ground color below and also the proximity of other MAVs as sensed by eight sensors around the MAV.  However, the MAVs in the demo have no brains and cannot crash into one another.
