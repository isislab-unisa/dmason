sim/portrayal/network

This package holds 2D FieldPortrayals for the Network field.

NetworkPortrayal2D.java

A FieldPortrayal for the Network field.  Actually requires TWO fields: a 
Network field which contains the nodes and edges in the network, and a 
Continuous2D or SparseGrid2D which specifies the location in 2D space of 
the NODES.  The FieldPortrayal then draws the edges by querying the 
Continuous2D or SparseGrid2D for where the ends of the edges should be 
located.  The FieldPortrayal does NOT draw any nodes -- you should draw 
those by using a ContinuousPortrayal2D or SparseGridPortrayal2D on the 
same fields.


SpatialNetwork2D.java

A class which holds both a Network and either a Continuous2D or 
SparseGrid2D as discussed above.  The SpatialNetwork2D object is the 
object provided to the NetworkPortrayal2D to "portray".


SimpleEdgePortrayal2D.java

A SimplePortrayal designed to draw edges for the NetworkPortrayal2D.  
You can create your own subclasses if you don't like our implementation.


EdgeDrawInfo2D.java

An extension of sim/portrayal/DrawInfo2D which includes the location of
the second point of the edge.  Passed to SimpleEdgePortrayal2D to tell
it how and where to draw its edges.
