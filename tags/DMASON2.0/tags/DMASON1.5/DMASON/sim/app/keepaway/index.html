<h2>Keep-Away Soccer</h2> 
By Daniel Kuebrich
</table>

<p>Keep-away soccer is a simple soccer game where three slower agents attempt kick a ball amongst themselves, attempting to keep it from being intercepted by a faster player.  This demo is a rudimentary platform for keep-away soccer: the agents have no strategy, and just chase the ball (and the faster agent gets it most of the time).
