<h2>3D Woims</h2> 
By Liviu Panait and Gabriel Balan

<font size="-2" color="gray">[Requires Java3D]</font>

<p>A 3D version of Woims example.  The environment, though 3D, is wrap-around, which can be somewhat disconcerting.

<p><hr>
<b>From Woims:</b> The flocking worms avoid obstacles and one anothers' heads (their bodies may cross) and move in a pleasant worm-like fashion.  You can click on the head and change the length of the worm. 

<p>For the interested, the name "Woims" is a play on <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">"Boids"</a>, Craig Reynolds' bird-flocking model which won him a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/1998#Scientific_and_Engineering_Award">techincal Oscar</a>.  It was pointed out to us later on that, of course, worms don't flock.
