sim/portrayal3D/network

This package holds 3D FieldPortrayals for the Network field and various 
SimplePortrayals for drawing edges.


NetworkPortrayal3D.java

A 3D FieldPortrayal for the Network field.  Actually requires TWO 
fields: a Network field which contains the nodes and edges in the 
network, and a Continuous3D or SparseGrid3D which specifies the location 
in 3D space of the NODES.  The FieldPortrayal then draws the edges by 
querying the Continuous3D or SparseGrid3D for where the ends of the 
edges should be located.  The FieldPortrayal does NOT draw any nodes -- 
you should draw those by using a ContinuousPortrayal3D or 
SparseGridPortrayal3D on the same fields.


SpatialNetwork3D.java

A class which holds both a Network and either a Continuous3D or 
SparseGrid3D as discussed above.  The SpatialNetwork3D object is the 
object provided to the NetworkPortrayal3D to "portray".


SimpleEdgePortrayal3D.java

A basic class for drawing edges as simple colored lines.


GenericEdgePortrayal3D.java

A generic superclass for drawing edges as 3D volumes.  A subclass of 
SimpleEdgePortryal3D.


ArrowEdgePortrayal3D.java

A subclass of GenericEdgePortrayal3D which draws edges as arrows.


PrimitiveEdgePortrayal3D.java

A generic superclass for drawing edges with Primitives or Shape3D 
objects.  A subclass of GenericEdgePortrayal3D.


ConeEdgePortrayal3D.java

A subclass of PrimitiveEdgePortrayal3D.java which draws edges as 
elongated cones.


CylinderEdgePortrayal3D.java

A subclass of PrimitiveEdgePortrayal3D.java which draws edges as 
elongated cylinders.
