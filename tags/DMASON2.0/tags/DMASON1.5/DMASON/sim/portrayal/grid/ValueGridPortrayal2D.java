/**
   This class is capable of portraying the DoubleGrid2D and IntGrid2D fields (and <b>only</b> those two fields -- or subclasses).
   It is fairly customizable, and this flexibility
   comes at a cost in drawing speed.  If you just need to draw your field as a grid of squares, you might look into
   the much simpler, and faster (and aptly named) FastValueGridPortrayal2D instead.

   <p>Like other FieldPortrayal2Ds, this class uses an underlying SimplePortrayal2D to draw each separate element
   in the grid.  A default SimplePortrayal2D is provided which draws squares.  In the default, the color for the square is
   determined by looking up the value of the square in a user-provided color-table, or if there is none, by
   interpolating it between two user-provided colors.  See the setColorTable() and setLevels() methods. 

   <p>Here's a trick you might consider in specifying interpolations.  Rather than draw from white to red (for example),
   you might consider setting the backdrop of the display to white, and then instead draw from FULLY TRANSPARENT white to
   FULLY OPAQUE red.  That is, from Color(0,0,0,0) to Color(255,0,0,255).  Fully transparent colors are not drawn; and not drawing
   at all is significantly faster than drawing for no reason!  Plus you can stack multiple ValueGridPortrayal2Ds on top
   of one another and let the transparency bleed through for a nice effect.  The alpha channel is your friend.

   <p>By default the min Level and the max Level are the same (1.0), and the alpha values for both are 0 (totally transparent).
   Thus if you want a range, you must specify it.  This is intentional, because this way if you want to use a color
   table instead (say, to specify three colors for the integers 0, 1, and 2), you can specify them, and ALL other grid values
   will be automatically transparent.

   <p>If you would like more control over the color of your values (perhaps to implement a nonlinear function of the colors),
   you can override the getColor() function to define your own custom color.

   <p>You can also provide your own custom SimplePortrayal2D (use setPortrayalForAll(...) ) to draw elements as you
   see fit rather than as rectangles.  Your SimplePortrayal2D should expect objects passed to its draw method
   to be of type MutableDouble.  Do not hold onto this array -- it will be reused.
   
   The 'location' passed
   into the DrawInfo2D handed to the SimplePortryal2D is a MutableInt2D.
