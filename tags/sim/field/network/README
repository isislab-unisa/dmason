sim/field/network

This package holds common representations of directed and undirected graphs.


Network.java

Places objects either as nodes or as edges in a directed or indirected graph.
Nodes are simply objects.  Edges are actually the 'Edge' class below, which
can hold an 'information' object of your choice associated with each edge.


Edge.java

The wrapper object for edges.  Holds objects associated with the edges.
