sim/field/grid

This package holds common representations of 2D and 3D discretized space.


Grid2D.java

An interface for functions common to most 2D grids, including computations
for toroidal space, hexagonal and triangular space, and height and width.


Grid3D.java

An interface for functions common to most 3D grids, including computations
for toroidal space, and height, depth, and width.


AbstractGrid2D.java

An abstract but concrete implementation of many of the functions in Grid2D.


AbstractGrid3D.java

An abstract but concrete implementation of many of the functions in Grid3D.


IntGrid2D.java

A 2D grid of integers (basically a wrapper for a 2D int array).


IntGrid3D.java

A 3D grid of integers (basically a wrapper for a 3D int array).


DoubleGrid2D.java

A 2D grid of doubles (basically a wrapper for a 2D double array).


DoubleGrid3D.java

A 3D grid of doubles (basically a wrapper for a 3D double array).


ObjectGrid2D.java

A 2D grid of Objects of all kinds (basically a wrapper for a 2D Object array).


ObjectGrid3D.java

A 3D grid of Objects of all kinds (basically a wrapper for a 3D Object array).


SparseGrid2D.java

A 2D sparse grid of Objects, subclassing from sim/field/SparseField.java.
These Objects are not stored in an array but are rather associated with 2D
locations via a hash table.


SparseGrid3D.java

A 3D Sparse grid of Objects, subclassing from sim/field/SparseField.java.
These Objects are not store in an array but are rather associated with 3D
locations via a hash table.
