# This is the simulation.classes file, which specifies which
# classes appear in the pop-up menu when the user chooses
# "New Simulation..." from the File menu.  Empty lines in
# this file are ignored, as is any part of a line which 
# starts with a pound sign.

# If you put the word 'ONLY' (no quotes) all by itself on
# a line in this file, it will tell MASON to not allow the
# user to type in his own classes: he will *only* be able
# to choose from this list.

# If immediately BEFORE a class you put a line starting 
# with 'NAME:' (no quotes), # followed by some text, this
# text will then be considered the "short name" of the
# simulation to display in the pop-up simulation chooser.
# The reason you would do this in addition to puttiing
# the name in the getName() static method is because it
# prevents MASON from needing to load your class files just
# to find out what name to display -- if you do a lot of
# set up at class load time, this saves a lot of load time.
# Note, however, that you should only do so for classes that
# you *know* the user will be able to load later on,
# because they'll get included in the class list even if
# the user can't choose them.  Notably the Java3D classes
# may not necessarily be around.
