/** The Network is a field which stores binary graph and multigraph structures of all kinds, using hash tables to allow
    reasonably rapid dynamic modification.
    
    <p>The nodes of a Network's graph can be any arbitrary, properly hashable object.  The edges of the
    graph are members of the Edge class.  This class is little more than a wrapper around an arbitrary object as well (the Edge's 'info'
    object).  Thus your graph's nodes and edges can essentially be objects entirely of your choosing.
    
    <p>Edge objects also contain pointers to the Nodes that they are to and from (plus some auxillary index information
    for speed).
    
    <p>Nodes and Edges are stored in the Network using two data structures: a Bag containing all the nodes in the Field;
    and a HashMap which maps each Node to a container holding the Node's index in the Bag, plus a Bag of the Node's outgoing
    Edges and a Bag of the Node's incoming Edges.  Ordinarily you won't fool with these structures other than to scan through
    them (in particular, to scan rapidly through the allNodes bag rather than use an iterator).
    
    <p>To add a node to the Network, simply use addNode(node).  To remove a node, use removeNode(node).
    To add an edge to the Network, use addEdge(fromNode,toNode,edgeInfoObject), where edgeInfoObject is your
    arbitrary edge object. Alternatively, you can make an Edge object from scratch and add it with addEdge(new Edge(fromNode, toNode, edgeInfoObject)).
    You remove edges with removeEdge(edge).  If you add an edge, and its nodes have not been added yet, they will
    automatically be added as well.
    
    <p>Traversing a Network is easy.  
    To get a Bag of all the incoming (or outgoing) Edges to a node, use getEdgesIn(node) or getEdgesOut(node).
    Do <b>not</b> add or remove Edges from this Bag -- it's used internally and we trust you here.  Also don't expect the
    Bag to not change its values mysteriously later on.  Make a copy of the Bag if you want to keep it and/or modify it.
    Once you have an Edge, you can call its to() method and from() methods to get the nodes it's from and to, and you can
    at any time get and modify its info object.  The to() and from() are fast and inlined.
    
    <p>However, the getEdgesIn(node) and getEdgesOut(node) methods are not super fast: they require a hash lookup.  If you
    are planning on applying an algorithm on the Network which doesn't change the topology at all but traverses it a lot
    and changes just the <b>contents</b> of the edge info objects and the node object contents, you might consider first 
    getting an adjacency list for the Network with getAdjacencyList(...), or an adjacency matrix with getAdjacencyMatrix(...)
    or getMultigraphAdjacencyMatrix(...).  But remember that as soon as the topology changes (adding/deleting a node or edge),
    the adjacency list is invalid, and you need to request another one.
    
    <p><b>Computational Complexity.</b>  Adding a node or an edge is O(1).  Removing an edge is O(1).  Removing a node is O(m), where
    m is the total number of edges in and out of the node.  Removing all nodes is O(1) and fast.  Getting the in-edges or out-edges for a node
    is O(1).  Getting the to or from node for an edge is O(1) and fast.
    
    <p><b>Warning About Hashing.</b>  Java's hashing method is broken in an important way.  One can override the hashCode() and equals()
    methods of an object so that they hash by the value of an object rather than just the pointer to it.  But if this is done, then if
    you use this object as a key in a hash table, then <i>change</i> those values in the object, it will break the hash table -- the key
    and the object hashed by it will both be lost in the hashtable, unable to be accessed or removed from it.  The moral of the story is:
    do not override hashCode() and equals() to hash by value unless your object is <i>immutable</i> -- its values cannot be changed.  This
    is the case, for example, with Strings, which hash by value but cannot be modified.  It's also the case with Int2D, Int3D, Double2D,
    and Double3D, as well as Double, Integer, etc.  Some of Sun's own objects are broken in this respect: Point, Point2D, etc. are both
    mutable <i>and</i> hashed by value.
    
    <p>This affects you in only one way in a Network: edges are hashed by nodes.  The Network permits you to use any object
    as a node -- but you have been suitably warned: if you use a mutable but hashed-by-value node object, do NOT modify its values while
    it's being used as a key in the Network.
    
    <p><b>Directed vs. Undirected Graphs.</b>  Networks are constructed to be either directed or undirected, and they cannot be changed
    afterwards.  If the network is directed, then an Edge's to() and from() nodes have explicit meaning: the Edge goes from() one node to()
    another.  If the network is undirected, then to() and from() are simply the two nodes at each end of the Edge with no special meaning,
    though they're always consistent.  The convenience method <i>edge</i>.getOtherNode(<i>node</i>) will provide "other" node (if node is to(),
    then from() is returned, and vice versa).  This is particularly useful in undirected graphs where you could be entering an edge as to()
    or as from() and you just want to know what the node on the other end of the edge is.
        
    <p>There are three methods for getting all the edges attached to a node: getEdgesIn(), getEdgesOut(), and the less efficient getEdges().  These methods
    work differently depending on whether or not the network is directed:
        
    <p><table width="100%" border=0>
    <tr><td><td><b>Directed</b><td><b>Undirected</b>
    <tr><td><b>getEdgesIn()</b><td>Bag&nbsp;of&nbsp;incoming&nbsp;edges<td>Bag&nbsp;of&nbsp;all&nbsp;edges
    <tr><td><b>getEdgesOut()</b><td>Bag&nbsp;of&nbsp;outgoing&nbsp;edges<td>Bag&nbsp;of&nbsp;all&nbsp;edges
    <tr><td><b>getEdges()</b><td><i>Modifiable</i>&nbsp;Bag&nbsp;of&nbsp;all&nbsp;edges<td><i>Modifiable</i>&nbsp;Bag&nbsp;of&nbsp;all&nbsp;edges
    </table>
        
    <p><b>Hypergraphs.</b> Network is binary.  In the future we may provide a Hypergraph facility if it's needed, but for now you'll
    need to make "multi-edge nodes" and store them in the field, then hook them to your nodes via Edges.  For example, to store the
    relationship foo(node1, node2, node3), here's one way to do it:
    <ol>
    <li>Make a special foo object.
    <li>field.addEdge(foo,node1,new Double(0));
    <li>field.addEdge(foo,node2,new Double(1));
    <li>field.addEdge(foo,node3,new Double(2));
    </ol>
