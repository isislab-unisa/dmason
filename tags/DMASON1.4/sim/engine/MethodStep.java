/** 
    A Steppable which calls an underlying method using Java's reflection system.  The underlying method can either have no arguments
    or have one argumen (SimState), and is specified by its name as a String.

    <p>You can use MethodStep to call methods on classes that aren't Steppables.  For example, if you have an object <b>myObject</b>
    and wish to submit both its <b>foo</b> and <b>bar</b> methods (no arguments) to be called at various times when the Schedule
    sees fit, you might do this:

    <pre><tt>
    MyClass myObject = ... ;
    schedule.scheduleRepeating( ... , new MethodStep(myObject, "foo"), ...);
    schedule.scheduleRepeating( ... , new MethodStep(myObject, "bar"), ...);
    </tt></pre>

    <p>This will call the <b>foo()</b> method and <b>bar()</b> method to be called at the appropriate times on myObject. 

    <p>You can also use MethodStep to pop up objects which aren't Steppables by their nature.  For example:

    <pre><tt>
    JFrame myJFrame = ... ;
    schedule.schedule( ... , new MethodStep(myJFrame, "show"), ...);
    </tt></pre>

    <p>MethodStep can also be called on methods which expect to be passed in the Steppable's <b>SimState</b> argument.  When
    the MethodStep is called, it passes its argument to them.  You do this by adding a <b>true</b> to the constructor:

    <pre><tt>
    MyClass myObject = ... ;
    schedule.scheduleRepeating( ... , new MethodStep(myObject, "baz", true), ...);
    schedule.scheduleRepeating( ... , new MethodStep(myObject, "quux", true), ...);
    </tt></pre>

    <p>This will call the <b>baz(SimState)</b> method and <b>quux(SimState)</b> method to be called at the appropriate times on myObject.

    <p>This method is mostly to help in ease of porting: but it's not good Java.  Reflection is slow and violates all sorts of design
    contracts -- generally speaking, you should use anonymous Steppables intead.  For example, the examples above could have instead been
    written this way:

    <pre><tt>
    final MyClass myObject = ... ;
    final JFrame myJFrame = ... ;
    schedule.scheduleRepeating( ... , new Steppable() { public void step(SimState state) { myObject.foo() } }, ...);
    schedule.scheduleRepeating( ... , new Steppable() { public void step(SimState state) { myObject.foo() } }, ...);
    schedule.schedule( ... , new Steppable() { public void step(SimState state) { myJFrame.show() } }, ...);
    schedule.scheduleRepeating( ... , new Steppable() { public void step(SimState state) { myObject.baz(state) } }, ...);
    schedule.scheduleRepeating( ... , new Steppable() { public void step(SimState state) { myObject.quux(state) } }, ...);
    </tt></pre>
