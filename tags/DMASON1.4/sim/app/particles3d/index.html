<p>A 3D version of the bouncing-particles example from Tutorial 3.

<p><font color=red>Note:</font> Due to flaws in Java3D, 3D Particles requires a tremendous amount of memory to visualize and quite some time to start and stop.  If the program fails from an out-of-memory error, see the README provided with the simulation.

<p><hr>
<b>From Tutorial 3:</b> An example of 2D particles bouncing around on a grid.  When particles intersect, they each choose a random direction to go (including staying put).  Particles bounce off the wall and leave trails.
