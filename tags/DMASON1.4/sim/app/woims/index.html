<h2>Woims</h2> 
By Liviu Panait
</table>

<p>An early test of our continuous toroidal field.  The flocking worms avoid obstacles and one anothers' heads (their bodies may cross) and move in a pleasant worm-like fashion.  You can click on the head and change the length of the worm. 

<p>For the interested, the name "Woims" is a play on <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">"Boids"</a>, Craig Reynolds' bird-flocking model which won him a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Academy_Awards_USA/1998#Scientific_and_Engineering_Award">techincal Oscar</a>.  It was pointed out to us later on that, of course, worms don't flock.  

<p>When the head wraps around the screen, the whole worm is transported to the other side.  We've fixed this by providing a gutter outside the window area, but long worms will disappear without warning.
