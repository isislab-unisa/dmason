<h2>Tutorial 5: Hooke's Law</h2>

<p>A demonstration of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke's_law">Hooke's Law</a>.  Balls of random location and mass are connected arbitrarily with rubber bands of random strength and minimum lax distance.  You can change the number of balls and bands.

<p>Because the system is initially at zero velociy, it stays in equilibribium.  But if a fast-moving ball were to suddenly increase in mass, the system would be thrown out of equilibrium and start heading off-screen.  Try it!  Inspect a ball and change it mid-run.

<p><hr><font color='red'>Note:</font> this description is different from the one which appears after following the tutorial documentation.  This is because the tutorial documentation overrides the <tt>getInfo</tt> method to provide a description.  If this method is not overridden, MASON instead tries to display a file called <tt>index.html</tt> stored in the same directory as the simulation (which is what's going on here).
