<p>Projections of a 3D grid into three 2D spaces.  In the grid are white spheres, and the projections reflect the number of spheres in that row.

<p>This tutorial shows off a variety of ways to warp a 2D field in response to the values stored in it.

<p><hr><font color='red'>Note:</font> this description is different from the one which appears after following the tutorial documentation.  This is because the tutorial documentation overrides the <tt>getInfo</tt> method to provide a description.  If this method is not overridden, MASON instead tries to display a file called <tt>index.html</tt> stored in the same directory as the simulation (which is what's going on here).
