<h2>Schelling Segregation</h2> 
By Sean Luke
</table>

<p>A variation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Schelling">Thomas Schelling</a>'s Segregation Model.  We model two groups of people: Red and Blue.  Each person prefers that there be at least <i>threshold</i> number of like-colored people living within <i>neighborhood</i> distance away from him.  If this is not the case, he will get up and move to another location.  In our version of the model, when a person wishes to move, he picks a random empty location to move to.  The model also includes uninhabitable gray areas.  See the <tt>Models</tt> tab to adjust these parameters.
