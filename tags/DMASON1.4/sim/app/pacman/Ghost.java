/** A ghost is an agent.  There are four ghosts, of course: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde.  Each has his
    own special behavior.  
        
    <p> 
    All PacMan Ghosts have a "target" grid position that they're trying
    to achieve.  For Blinky, for example, that target is where the Pac is himself.
    The way that each Ghost achieves its target is to determine what action, at the NEXT
    grid position, he should do.  Ghosts never reverse direction, so of the remaining options,
    they pick the option which would move them FROM the NEXT grid position to a spot that 
    is closest to the target.  It's a greedy strategy but works reasonably well -- the
    refusal to reverse direction affects an effective Bug strategy of sorts (a common
    robotics path-charting procedure).
        
    <p>We'll assume that the Ghosts don't use the NEXT grid position but
    use the CURRENT grid position, and only compute a new action to perform
    when they're able to move (other than go in reverse, which they never do).

    <p>
    See http://home.comcast.net/~jpittman2/pacman/pacmandossier.html
    for a very good description.
        
    <p>Unlike regular pacman ghosts, we don't have a scatter target (except Clyde, who needs it for his algorithm).
