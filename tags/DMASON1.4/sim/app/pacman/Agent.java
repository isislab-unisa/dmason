/** An agent is either a Pac or a Ghost -- something which is capable of moving about.
    Agents have a previous action they've done which determines their "orientation".

    <p>Agents live in a continuous 2D world but associate that world with the grid environment
    of the maze.  The continuous location of the agent is 'location'.  Agents can't actually be
    *any* continuous location but rather are one of a set of finely-discretized locations.  The
    degree of discretization is 'discretization', and it in turn affects the speed of the agent
    (as the agent steps through the discretized locations to move from grid location to grid location,
    how fine the discretization is determines how many steps he must move to get from one grid
    location to another, and thus his speed going through the maze).
