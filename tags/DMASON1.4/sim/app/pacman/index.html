<h2>MASON Pac Man</h2> 
By Sean Luke and Vittorio Zipparo
</table>

<p>A two-player, two-map MASON PacMan implementation with no Console: it starts up just like a video game.  We've set it up to be easily modifiable: with quick code modifications you can have as many or few Pacs as you like; or change the monsters; or add more maps (they're just PBM images).  Have fun!
