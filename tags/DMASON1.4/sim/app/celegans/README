This project was an attempt by me to convert some old code I developed while
hanging out at Sony Computer Science Laboratories in 1998.  The code's function is
for visualizing the C. elegans worm, and when it was developed, Java3D had
*just* came out (and Java was barely three years old).  My goal was to see
how quickly one could convert the whole thing over to MASON.  Answer: about a day.

As a result, the code has some peculiarities: the big one is a "Synapse" object
which has to be converted into an "Edge" object.  I might clean that up in the
future.  Also, Java3D, as used by MASON, can't handle all those synapses
in real time (about 4000 of them).   So the synapse display is hidden by default.
We'll need to think about how to increase Java3D's efficiency.

The code is also very "old style" Java -- though I brought a few elements up
to current form while converting it over.

The database is a cleaned-up version of the AceDB neural and cellular structure
information (http://www.acedb.org/), converted into a format that made it easy
to parse.  It's dated around 1997.  Probably much better data is available, 
perhaps from WormBase (http://www.wormbase.org/), but the original data 
should suffice for now.
