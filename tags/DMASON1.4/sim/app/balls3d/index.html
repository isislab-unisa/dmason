<p>A reimplementation of the Hooke's Law example from Tutorial 5 in 3D.

<p><hr>

<b>From Tutorial 5:</b> A demonstration of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke's_law">Hooke's Law</a>.  Balls of random location and mass are connected arbitrarily with rubber bands of random strength and minimum lax distance.  You can change the number of balls and bands.

<p>Because the system is initially at zero velociy, it stays in equilibribium.  But if a fast-moving ball were to suddenly increase in mass, the system would be thrown out of equilibrium and start heading off-screen.  Try it!  Inspect a ball and change it mid-run.
