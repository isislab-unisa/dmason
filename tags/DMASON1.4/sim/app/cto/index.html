<h2>Cooperative Target Observation</h2> 
By Keith Sullivan, Liviu Panait, Gabriel Balan, and Sean Luke
</table>

<p>In Cooperative Target Observation, a number of agents need to keep under continuous surveillance a set of moving targets.  The model is implemented using the Continuous2D field in MASON.  In this simple demo, the agents use the KMeans algorithm to cluster the targets (based on proximity).  The targets move toward randomly chosen destinations.

<p>A much more advanced version of the software was used for a paper at the AAMAS-2005 conference: "Tunably Decentralized Algorithms for Cooperative Target Observation", http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/papers/luke05tunable.pdf Related papers may be found at the <a href="http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/">ECLab website</a>
