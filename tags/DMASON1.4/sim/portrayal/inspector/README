This package holds Property Inspectors and other kinds of special 
Inspectors.  Note that PropertyInspectors usually are loaded 
DYNAMICALLY.  This is done by registering them in the 
propertyinspector.classes file.



Classes:


TabbedInspector.java

Not a property inspector: this is a simple Inspector which enables you 
to add multiple subsidiary Inspectors, each appearing in a tabbed 
interface.  Intended for when your Inspector is getting too big and it'd 
be nice to break it into pieces.


PropertyInspector.java

The abstract superclass of PropertyInspectors, which are inspectors 
which examine not a whole object but simply a property of that object.  
Commonly used for creating charts and graphs.


StreamingPropertyInspector.java

A PropertyInspector which writes out the values of the property being 
inspected, over time, to a window or to a file or stdout.


ChartingPropertyInspector.java

The superclass of PropertyInspectors which perform charting.  Creates or 
shares a chart and plots property information on the chart as it changes 
over time.


TimeSeriesChartingPropertyInspector.java

A ChartingPropertyInspector which creates a time-series plot chart of 
the property as it changes over time.  Intended for properties that are 
boolean, integer, or double valued (or can provide the same).


HistogramChartingPropertyInspector.java

A ChartingPropertyInspector which creates and updates a histogram.  
Intended for properties that are (typically) arrays or other lists of 
doubles.


StableLocation.java

A superclass of wrappers for 2D integer or 2D double locations.  Needed 
to inspect SparseFields of various sorts because SparseFields 
continuously return new underlying objects for those locations, which 
then appear to be "new locations" to the inspectors even though they're 
not.  You probably don't need to worry about these.


StableInt2D.java

A StableLocation concrete implementation for 2D integer locations.


StableDouble2D.java 

A StableLocation concrete implementation for 2D double locations.
