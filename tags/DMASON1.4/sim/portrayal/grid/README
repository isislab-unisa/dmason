sim/portrayal/grid

This package holds 2D FieldPortrayals for various 2D Grid fields.

Many of these FieldPortrayals take two versions; a "regular" version, 
and a "fast" version.  The "regular" version looks up SimplePortrayals 
for each underlying object and has the SimplePortrayals portray those 
objects in any custom way you like.  The "fast" versions just draw quick 
and dirty representations of the objects themselves, entirely ignoring 
any stored SimplePortrayals.

The FieldPortrayals also have hexagonal versions to display fields which 
were intended to be hexagonal.


ValueGridPortrayal2D.java

A FieldPortrayal for the IntGrid2D and DoubleGrid2D fields.


HexaValueGridPortrayal2D.java

A FieldPortrayal for the IntGrid2D and DoubleGrid2D fields which 
displays the grids in hexagonal form.


FastValueGridPortrayal2D.java

A FieldPortrayal for the IntGrid2D and DoubleGrid2D fields which 
displays the underlying objects as simple colored rectangles in a grid.


FastHexaValueGridPortrayal2D.java

A FieldPortrayal for the IntGrid2D and DoubleGrid2D fields which 
displays the underlying objects as simple colored rectangles or hexagons 
in a grid.


ObjectGridPortrayal2D.java

A FieldPortrayal for the ObjectGrid2D field.


HexaObjectGridPortrayal2D.java

A FieldPortrayal for the ObjectGrid2D field which displays grids in 
hexagonal form.


FastObjectGridPortrayal2D.java

A FieldPortrayal for the ObjectGrid2D field which displays the 
underlying objects as simple colored rectangles in a grid.


FastHexaObjectGridPortrayal2D.java

A FieldPortrayal for the ObjectGrid2D field which displays the 
underlying objects as simple colored rectangles or hexagons in a grid.


SparseGridPortrayal2D.java

A FieldPortrayal for the SparseGrid2D field.


HexaSparseGridPortrayal2D.java

A FieldPortrayal for the SparseGrid2D field which displays grids in 
hexagonal form.


DrawPolicy.java

A simple class for defining the order that multiple objects should be 
drawn if they all sit in the same grid location.  Used by 
SparseGridPortrayal2D, which is presently the only grid which allows 
multiple objects at the same location.
