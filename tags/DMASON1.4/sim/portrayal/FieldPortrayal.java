/**
   A FieldPortrayal is an object which knows how to portray some kind of Field.

   <p>This abstract version of FieldPortrayal provides some basic functionality that
   many FieldPortrayals may find handy.  This functionality allows a FieldPortrayal
   to store Portrayal objects responsible for drawing various objects within the
   Field.  For example, a SparseGrid2D holds a bunch of objects: the SparseGridPortrayal2D,
   which is a FieldPortrayal, lets you store Portrayal objects which know how to draw
   the various objects in the SparseGrid2D.

   <p>You can associate a Portrayal object with an object stored in the Field in several
   ways.  First, you can specify one Portrayal object to be used for ALL objects stored
   in the field, using <b>setPortrayalForAll</b>.  Second, you can specify a Portrayal
   object to be used for objects in a Field all belonging to the same class, using
   <b>setPortrayalForClassOf</b>.  Third, you can specify a Portrayal for a specific
   object, using <b>setPortrayalForObject</b>.

   <p>You can get the desired Portrayal for an object by calling <b>getPortrayalForObject</b>.
   This method looks up the Portrayal for an object by going down the following checklist
   until a Portrayal is found (earlier checklist items take precedence over later ones):

   <ol>
   <li>
   If there is a portrayalForAll, return it.
   <li>If the object is null:
   <ol>
   <li>Return the portrayalForNull if there is one
   <li>
   If a portrayal is explicitly registered for null, return that portrayal.
   <li>Return the defaultNullPortrayal.
   </ol>
   <li>If the object is non-null:
   <ol>
   <li>If the object implements the appropriate Portrayal interface, return the object itself as its own Portrayal.
   <li>Return the portrayalForNonNull if there is one
   <li>
   If a portrayal is explicitly registered for the object, return that portrayal.  Portrayals may be registered for <tt>null</tt> as well.
   <li>
   <li> 
   If a Portrayal is registered for the object's exact class (superclasses are ignored), return that portrayal.
   <li>
   Return the portrayalForRemainder if there is one
   <li>
   Return the default Portrayal object.
   </ol>
   </ol>

   <p>FieldPortrayals store Portrayal objects in WeakHashMaps.  This means that if you register a Portrayal explicitly for an object, and then later the object is eliminated from your model, the FieldPortrayal will not hold onto the object or onto its Portrayal, but will allow them to garbage collect as well.  Thus you don't have to worry about de-registering an object.
   
   <p> Some FieldPortrayals benefit (draw faster) if they know that their underlying field is immutable,
   that is, it never changes. Notably, most FieldPortrayal3Ds benefit, as well as various ValueGrid2DPortrayals.
