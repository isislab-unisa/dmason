/**
   A wrapper for other Portrayal2Ds which makes it possible to drag and move objects with the mouse.
   
   <p>This portrayal is used simply by wrapping around another portrayal or around null (if the object portrays itself).

   <p>If you declare a MovablePortrayal2D for an object, you will be able to move it in any field
   portrayal which supports the basic functions for moving objects.  These at present are the
   various Sparse portrayals and the Continuous2D portrayal.
        
   <p>Moving an object also selects it and deselects other objects.
   
   <p>It's possible that an object wants to control how it's moved.  For example, you may have
   objects which maintain their own internal location and don't like to be moved without being
   informed.  You can still use them with MovablePortrayal2D if they implement the Fixed2D interface,
   implementing its sole method to move themselves in their field, and then returning false.  Similarly
   objects can implement this interface to simply deny moving at all, for example at certain points of time
   in the simulation.

   <p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> If using AdjustablePortrayal2D in conjunction with MovablePortrayal2D, 
   always wrap the MovablePortrayal2D inside the AdjustablePortrayal2D, not the other way around.
