This is a portion of the CERN JET library dealing with sampling distributions
(portions of cern.jet.random, cern.jet.math, and cern.jet.stat) modified in
various ways to make the library more useful as part of the MASON toolkit.
Most importantly, the package has been set up so that you use
MersenneTwisterFast as the random number generator behind these distributions.

This stuff is very early and subject to non backward compatible change.  You
have been warned.  Also I make no claims about the quality of the 
samples produced by this code: though generally CERN JET/COLT has a fairly
good reputation.


WHAT'S IN THE PACKAGE

The package is primarily intended to enable you to generate random numbers
under a wide variety of distributions.  The package provides separate classes
for the following distributions:

	Beta, Binomial, Breit-Wigner (Lorentz), Mean-Square Breit-Wigner,
	Chi-Square, Empirical, Discrete Imperical ("EmpiricalWalker"),
	Exponential, Exponential Power, Gamma, Hyperbolic, Hypergeometric,
	Logarithmic, NegativeBinomial, Normal (Gaussian), Poisson (in two
	different forms), Student's T, Uniform, Von Mises, and Zeta.

These classes work by instantiating a distribution with a given
Mersenne Twister random number generator, then pulling random numbers out
of the distribution.  I would just make one distribution of a given kind.
There shouldn't be any reason you couldn't use the same Mersenne Twister
for various different distributions.  Of course, Uniform and Normal aren't
very useful since they're provided by the random number generator itself.  
But there you have it.

Additionally, the "Distributions" class provides several additional
distributions which don't require internal state to compute and so can be
performed with a single function each:

	Burr (various kinds), Cauchy, Erlang, Geomeric, Lambda, Laplace,
	Logistic, Power-Law, Triangular, Weibull, and Zipf.

These distributions work by simply passing the Mersenne Twister in as a
parameter to the static method, and out pops a single random number under
the distribution.


WHERE THE PACKAGE CAME FROM

http://acs.lbl.gov/~hoschek/colt/

The COLT package is quite a bit bigger than just these distributions,
including a lot of numerical computing.  The last update to the package was
five years ago however, so it may be suffering from some bit-rot.  If you
cannot get the colt JAR file from this distribution, try Repast, which has
it as part of their system.


CHANGES FOR MASON COMPATIBILITY

Changes were made to make it easy to use the package with MASON's RNG
of choice; to conform with MASON's package structures so as to not require
a separate jar file; and to make the code easier to serialize.

        - All static random number generator code has been removed
        - The Stack class has been merged into the EmpiricalWalker class
        - The Benchmark class has been removed
        - The cern.jet.math.Polynomial, cern.jet.math.Constants,
          cern.jet.math.Arithmetic, and cern.jet.stat.Probability classes
          have been merged into this package.  The cern.jet.stat.Gamma class
          has been merged with the Probability class.
        - Interfaces and superclasses have been removed from the
          AbstractDistribution class
        - AbstractDistribution no longer clones its random number generator
          when cloned, but rather shares it as a pointer.
        - Various Uniform constructors have been deleted

... and the big ones:

        - RandomGenerator has been replaced with MersenneTwisterFast
        - The package has been changed to sim.util.distribution
