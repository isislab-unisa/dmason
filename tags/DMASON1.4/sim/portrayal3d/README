sim/portrayal3D

This package holds 3D visualization objects (Portrayals).  See the
README for sim/portrayal for more information on Portrayals (and read
the documentation and tutorials!)

All *2D* portrayals are stored in sim/portrayal, not here.

The subpackages are:

grid		FieldPortrayals for 2D and 3D grids
continuous	FieldPortrayals for 2D and 3D continuous space.
network		FieldPortrayals for 3D representations of networks
simple		SimplePortrayals for basic objects of all kinds.
inspector	Auxillary inspector stuff.


Classes:


Portrayal3D.java

An interface for all 3D Portrayals, both FieldPortrayals and 
SimplePortrayals.


FieldPortrayal3D.java

An abstract superclass of all 3D FieldPortrayals.


SimplePortrayal3D.java

A superclass of all 3D SimplePortrayals.  The default SimplePortrayal3D 
doesn't portray objects as anything (they're invisible).
