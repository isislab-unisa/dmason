sim

This package holds most of the MASON simulation toolkit.  The exception 
is MersenneTwister, which is in the 'ec' package to retain compatibility 
with MASON's sister toolkit, ECJ.

If you're looking for the top-level README and documentation, look in the
'mason' directory, which is the parent directory of this one.

The subpackages are:

engine		The simulation core, including the schedule
field		Data structures representing 2D and 3D space and networks
		(so-called 'fields')
display		2D Visualization GUI elements
portrayal	Objects used by the 2D display package to represent the objects
		in various fields in your simulation
display3d	3D Visualization GUI elements
portrayal3d	Objects used by the 3D display package to represent the objects
		in various fields in your simulation
util		Utility classes
