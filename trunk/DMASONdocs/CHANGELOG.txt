- Renewed GlobalViewer interface, now embedding Global Inspector
- Ability to independently track distributed statistics (see Introduction to Global Inspector and notes) and graphics
- Use Log4J for debug of the regions (id of region, number of agents, timestamp start step, timestamp end step)
- Use Log4j for logging by master of the parameters of the simulation
- Setting of parameters (split and merge factors, see tutorial) for load balancing from the simulation
- Error message for wrong parameters for the load balancing configuration
- Added button for enabling/disabling the load balancing mechanism
- Peer auto reconnection using ActiveMQ failover
- Restart simulation using ActiveMQ jmx connection
