/** A wrapper for SimState and Schedule which provides additional functionality for
    GUI objects. This wrapper extends the functionality of SimState and
    Schedule through encapsulation, NOT subclassing.  Why?  Because the
    general idea is that SimState, and *anything* which hangs off of it,
    should be serializable out to a checkpoint and not know or care about whether
    or not it's running under a GUI or running headless.
    
    <p>Displays and Controllers (such as Display2D and the Console) do not care about the
    SimState, and make precious few calls to the Schedule.  Instead, they generally only
    work with you through the GUIState class.
    
    <p>GUIState has the same start() and finish() methods as SimState, and indeed
    the default forms of these methods just call start() and finish() on the underlying
    SimState.  Additionally, GUIState has init(Controller) and quit() methods.  The
    init(Controller) method sets up the GUIState to work in an environment controlled
    by the specified Controller.  The quit() method is called to tell the GUIState to
    shut down and free any of its resources (perhaps the simulation document is being
    closed in the GUI, or the GUI is quitting).  
    
    <p>GUIState also has two methods used by the Controller to specify things about it.
    In particular, <tt>public static String getName(Class class)</tt>
    should return an intelligent name for the simulation,
    and <tt>public static Object getInfo(Class class)</tt> should return an
    HTML or textual description of the simulation either as a URL or a String.
    
    <p>You can create a global inspector for your model (as opposed to the individual
    per-object inspectors created by various portrayals).  This is done by overriding either 
    getInspector() or getSimulationInspectedObject().
    
    <p>GUIState has a wrapper step() method which in turn calls the Schedule's
    step(state) method.  However, this wrapper lso provides a hook for objects such as
    displays to schedule themselves without using the Schedule.  This hook is the
    scheduleImmediate(...) and scheduleImmediateRepeat(...) methods.  There is also
    a reset() method which resets both the immediates and the underlying Schedule.
    
    <p>Last, GUIState has a wrapper function to make it convenient to read in a new SimState from
    a serialized file: readNewStateFromCheckpoint().  This function checks to see if the
    serialized file is valid for this simulation.  To do this, it calls validSimState(),
    which is a hook that you should override to return TRUE if the provided state is a valid SimState
    for your simulation (usually this means that it's the right subclass of SimState for your
    purposes).
    
    <p> Generally speaking, if you have access to a GUIState, you should use GUIstate methods
    start(), finish(), step(), reset(), and readNewStateFromCheckpoint() 
    instead of the underlying methods in the SimState and Controller.  Otherwise, feel free
    to use the underlying methods (such as Schedule.time()).
    
    <p><b>Exception Handling</b>.  It's a common error to schedule a null event, or one with an invalid time.
    Like Schedule, GUIState previously returned false or null in such situations, 
    but this leaves the burden on the programmer to check,
    and programmers are forgetful!  We have changed GUIState and Schedule to throw exceptions by default instead.  
    You can change them both back to returning false or null (perhaps if you want to handle the 
    situations yourself more efficiently than catching an exception, or if you know what you're doing schedule-wise)
    by setting Schedule.setThrowingScheduleExceptions(false).
