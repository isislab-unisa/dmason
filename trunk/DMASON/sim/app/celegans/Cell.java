/**
   Cell contains the basic information about a particular cell as loaded from the
   <a href="http://probe.nalusda.gov:8300/cgi-bin/browse/acedb">ACeDB database on
   C. elegans.</a>  The ACeDB database has a lot of bugs, so some of
   this data has been hacked; you have been warned.  Cell info is not based on any
   fancy modelling techniques of cell kinematics, dynamics, or even more reasonable
   interpolation methods like spline interpolation.  All it is is a faithful
   reproduction of the read data, with simple linear interpolation between spatial
   data points, using simple spheres (in the Java3D version) or points representing
   supposedly the "center" (or nucleus?) of each cell.

   <p>Hack highlights:

   <ul>
   <li>
   A number of cells don't have any location information.  Most notably, many
   of the early cells (like P0', the zygote) have no location info at all.  This
   data is hand-hacked for them, and badly too!

   <li>
   Some cells have no parent.  Now we all know that the only cell for which this
   can truly be the case is P0'.  I imagine there's some data inconsistency in
   the database.  If Cell.java comes across one of these cells, it includes its
   information but never displays it (what would you do with it?)

   <li>
   Many cells have different lineage and official names.  Hence the two names
   for each.

   <li>
   A few cells split into four cells rather than into two, or at least that's
   what the database says.  So the daughters[] array isn't *always* of size 2.

   <li>
   Volume information is unknown except for the initial split from P0' to AB and
   P1', where it's hand-hacked to give AB 60% of the volume.  Other than that,
   all splits assume equal volume sharing between children.

   <li>
   Many cells are POSTEMBRYONIC, meaning that they don't appear until after
   gastrulation has begun.  Unfortunately, no cell is given any spatial information
   after gastrulation and later cell development, so we don't know where these
   postembryonic cells are supposed to be located in space.  Further, no information
   is given as to when they are born; only their lineage.  So I've set it up so
   that times -1 through 499 are the embryo's "preembryonic period", and times from
   500 through 999 are the embryo's "postembryonic period".  Postembryonic cells are
   born one tick after their parent is born, or at time 500, whichever is later.  
   The position of postembryonic cells (they've got to be displayed *somewhere*)
   is based on simple cubic splitting of their parent's space and volume, so you'll
   see clumps of cells together as a result.  We had to do *something*!

   <li>
   The database indicates that some cells are fated to die.  Unfortunately, the
   database doesn't include this as a fate, but as a remark (ergh).  Furthermore,
   the data doesn't say WHEN the cell dies.  We assume here that such a cell dies
   as soon as it's born.

   <li>
   The database has two different data reconstructions.  We use the N2-EMB-1
   reconstruction.  Furthermore, the birthdays in the reconstruction don't jibe with
   the embryo division time of parents.  ARGH!!!  We assume the birthdays are
   correct, falling back on the embryo division time only when the birthdays aren't
   available.

   <li>
   New cells are assumed to start at their parent's last known position.  This is
   a suboptimal decision.

   <li>
   Some cells have dual origins.  This means that some cells X and Y might, depending
   on various conditions, assume different roles (and be given different names).  Thus
   X might "become" cell A and Y might "become" cell B, or X might become B and Y 
   might become A.  There are only a few cells which can trade lineage roles like this.
   The way we handle this in the visualizer is by assuming that X, Y, A, and B are
   different cells (they aren't of course), then picking a parentage (X is A's "parent",
   Y is B's parent, say) arbitrarily.  Of course, X isn't *really* A's parent, as it
   X and A are the same cell (or in other animals, X and B are the same cell).  But it
   simplifies the visualization issues.

   <li>
   Remarks are included, but not journals.  We don't have journal data unfortunately. 

   <li>
   Fates, cell groups, and expression patterns are included as far as we have
   information.  The information is VERY VERY sparse, missing a lot of key facts;
   hopefully people will fill in more details on each cell.  Cell death is 
   considered a "fate" even though it's listed in the remarks.

   <li>
   When cells split they are assumed to divide volume evenly among their children.
   We assume this because we have no other data to tell us otherwise; the one
   exception is the famous example where P0' splits to form AB and P1' (AB gets
   60% of the volume, right?).  We've hand-hacked this one exception.

   </ul>

   Cells have a lot of data, both raw and processed.  See the Cell.java code directly for comments on what this data all means.

        split_radius_distance.  Determine my split direction (report any cells who don't
