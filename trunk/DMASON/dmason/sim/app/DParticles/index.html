<p>An example of 2D particles bouncing around on a distributed grid .  When particles intersect, they each choose a random direction to go (including staying put).  Particles bounce off the wall and leave trails.

<p><hr><font color='red'>Note:</font> this description is different from the one which appears after following the tutorial documentation.  This is because the tutorial documentation overrides the <tt>getInfo</tt> method to provide a description.  If this method is not overridden, MASON instead tries to display a file called <tt>index.html</tt> stored in the same directory as the simulation (which is what's going on here).
