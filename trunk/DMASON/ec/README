ec

In a subpackage, ec/util/, is a single class: the Mersenne Twister random
number generator.  The reason this is in ec rather than in sim is simple:
MASON was intended in part to be compatible with ECJ, our evolutionary
computation toolkit (http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/), and we're
sharing ECJ's Mersenne Twister class.
